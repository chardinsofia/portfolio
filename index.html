	    		Photography always keeps me grounded. When my father hand me over an old camera, a little bit more stubborn version of me at the age of 14 develop her first 35mm film roll that came up entirely underexposed. I remember being completely angry and frustrated, taking the <i>Nikon F70</i> printed manual book and reading it all at once. It was like a super technical and complete analog photography masterclass. After that I was very pleased to have perfectly balanced and exposed pictures of my garden, my cat, my friends, the place I used to go to... That first approaches teach me to respect both the tool and the knowleadge, to not giving up and keeping the experiments on going. I built myself on that time as a very strict and perfectionist photographer. I've studied Photographic Expression in UNSAM, and almost got a Diplome. Unfortunately, I wasn't too good at the part of finishing degrees at that time.

				From developing film and editing images, the love for colors and textures grew in me, and after a few years of still photography, I started filming and editing audiovisual material. I found the search of harmony between sound and visuals very gratifying, it was a very good experience to learn and evolve in AV post-edition. All of this was mostly product of self-taught learning, experimentation, research and advices from colleagues and friends. I've always been an entrepreneur, enthusiast and curious person, but I must say, I did have some hard times, going through lapses of lack of inspiration and low self-esteem, but that's the funny part, those phases are part of the whole picture, and make the things I do, and the person I make of myself be better. So, if you're having a hard time, dont hesitate to write me or share it with someone, you'd be surprise of how easy the process can be when you take it as your own and let it be part of your development.
	    	</p>
	    	<p class="text">
	    		A few years ago, in some unfortunate circumstance, I lost thousands of hours of filming and a massive quantity of photographs from almost 10 years of work and trips around the world. I will never have those back, but this is some of what was left from that time, and I'm very happy to be able to give you, at least a glimpse of what it has been.
